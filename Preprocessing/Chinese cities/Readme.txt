Note: We haven't performed the reproducible run on the platform of CodeOcean as we are unable to share the original dataset, but these scripts can be well performed on PC.

By processing the script 'data_process.py', the original check-in data can be screened to a given geographical area on a given date.

Then, by operating the script 'Data array transform.py', the screened data can be converted to location-based time series data.
