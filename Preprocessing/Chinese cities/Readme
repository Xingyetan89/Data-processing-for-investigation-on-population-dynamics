By processing the script 'data_process.py', the originally crawled check-in data can be screened to a given geographical area on a given date and transformed into a data format as shown in 'Example result 1.txt'.
Then, by operating the script 'Data array transform.py', the data with the format shown in 'Example result 1.txt' can be coverted to location-based time series data as shown in 'Example result 2.csv'.
By creating fishnet in ArcGIS, we can spatially establish a grid-based reference and associate the location-based time series data (e.g., 'Example result 2.csv') with it.
By processing the script 'fishnet data.py' and 'Fishnet delete null rows', we can combine the records within the same grid and remove those grids without any records to finally form grid-based time series data.
